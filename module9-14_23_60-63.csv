Term,Definition
biological psychology,the scientific study of the links between biological (genetic  neural  hormonal) and psychological processes
neuron,a nerve cell; the basic building block of the nervous system
dendrites,a neuron’s bushy  branching extensions that receive messages and conduct impulses toward the cell body
axon,the neuron extension that passes messages through its branches to other neurons or to muscles or glands
sheath,a fatty tissue layer segmentally encasing the axons of some neurons; enables vastly greater transmission speed as neural impulses hop from one sausage-like node to the next
action potential,a neural impulse; a brief electrical charge that travels down an axon
refractory period,a period of inactivity after a neuron has fired
threshold,the level of stimulation required to trigger a neural impulse
none response,a neuron’s reaction of either firing (with a full-strength response) or not firing
neurotransmitters,chemical messengers that cross the synaptic gaps between neurons
reuptake,a neurotransmitter’s reabsorption by the sending neuron
agonist,a molecule that  by binding to a receptor site  stimulates a response
antagonist,a molecule that  by binding to a receptor site  inhibits or blocks a response
nerves,bundled axons that form neural “cables” connecting the central nervous system with muscles  glands  and sense organs
neurons,neurons that carry incoming information from the sensory receptors to the brain and spinal cord
neurons,neurons that carry outgoing information from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles and glands
somatic nervous system,the division of the peripheral nervous system that controls the body’s skeletal muscles
sympathetic nervous system,the division of the autonomic nervous system that arouses the body  mobilizing its energy in stressful situations
parasympathetic nervous system,the division of the autonomic nervous system that calms the body  conserving its energy
system,the body’s “slow” chemical communication system; a set of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream
hormones,chemical messengers that are manufactured by the endocrine glands travel through the bloodstream and affect other tissues
glands,a pair of endocrine glands that sit just above the kidneys and secrete hormones (epinephrine and norepinephrine) that help arouse the body in times of stress
pituitary gland,the endocrine system’s most influential gland
scan,a series of X-ray photographs taken from different angles and combined by computer into a composite representation of a slice of the brain’s structure
scan,a visual display of brain activity that detects where a radioactive form of glucose goes while the brain performs a given task
brainstem,the oldest part and central core of the brain  beginning where the spinal cord swells as it enters the skull; the brainstem is responsible for automatic survival functions
limbic system,neural system (including the hippocampus  amygdala  and hypothalamus) located below the cerebral hemispheres; associated with emotions and drives
not,“pleasure centers
cortex,the intricate fabric of interconnected neural cells covering the cerebral hemispheres; the body’s ultimate control and information­-­processing center
lobes,portion of the cerebral cortex lying at the top of the head and toward the rear; receives sensory input for touch and body position
temporal lobes,portion of the cerebral cortex lying roughly above the ears; includes the auditory areas  each receiving information primarily from the opposite ear
motor cortex,an area at the rear of the frontal lobes that controls voluntary movements
somatosensory cortex,area at the front of the parietal lobes that registers and processes body touch and movement sensations
association areas,areas of the cerebral cortex that are not involved in primary motor or sensory functions; rather  they are involved in higher mental functions such as learning  remembering  thinking  and speaking
known as plasticity,the brain’s ability to change  especially during childhood  by reorganizing after damage or by building new pathways based on experience
neurogenesis,the formation of new neurons
damage to,disrupts speaking  while damage to   disrupts understanding of language
split brain,a condition resulting from surgery that isolates the brain’s two hemispheres by cutting the fibers (mainly those of the corpus callosum) connecting them
consciousness,our awareness of ourselves and our environment
deliberate cognitive neuroscience,the interdisciplinary study of the brain activity linked with cognition (including perception  thinking  memory  and language)
dual processing,the principle that information is often simultaneously processed on separate conscious and unconscious tracks
behavior genetics,the study of the relative power and limits of genetic and environmental influences on behavior
environment,every external influence  from prenatal nutrition to the people and things around us
chromosomes,threadlike structures made of DNA molecules that contain the genes
genes,the biochemical units of heredity that make up the chromosomes; segments of DNA capable of synthesizing proteins
genome,the complete instructions for making an organism  consisting of all the genetic material in that organism’s chromosomes
molecular genetics,the subfield of biology that studies the molecular structure and function of genes
heritability,the proportion of variation among individuals that we can attribute to genes
epigenetics,the study of environmental influences on gene expression that occur without a DNA change
rhythm,the biological clock; regular bodily rhythms (for example  of temperature and wakefulness) that occur on a 24-hour cycle
alpha waves,the relatively slow brain waves of a relaxed  awake state
sleep,periodic  natural loss of consciousness—as distinct from unconsciousness resulting from a coma  general anesthesia  or hibernation
hallucinations,false sensory experiences  such as seeing something in the absence of an external visual stimulus
delta waves,the large  slow brain waves associated with deep sleep
intelligence,mental quality consisting of the ability to learn from experience  solve problems  and use knowledge to adapt to new situations
intelligence test,a method for assessing an individual’s mental aptitudes and comparing them with those of others  using numerical scores
factor analysis,a statistical procedure that identifies clusters of related items (called factors) on a test; used to identify different dimensions of performance that underlie a person’s total score
grit,in psychology  grit is passion and perseverance in the pursuit of long-term goals
emotional intelligence,the ability to perceive  understand  manage  and use emotions
mental age,a measure of intelligence test performance devised by Binet; the chronological age that most typically corresponds to a given level of performance
achievement test,a test designed to assess what a person has learned
aptitude test,a test designed to predict a person’s future performance; aptitude is the capacity to learn
standardization,defining uniform testing procedures and meaningful scores by comparison with the performance of a pretested group
normal curve,the symmetrical  bell­-­shaped curve that describes the distribution of many physical and psychological attributes
reliability,the extent to which a test yields consistent results  as assessed by the consistency of scores on two halves of the test  on alternate forms of the test  or on retesting
validity,the extent to which a test measures or predicts what it is supposed to
content validity,the extent to which a test samples the behavior that is of interest
predictive validity,the success with which a test predicts the behavior it is designed to predict; it is assessed by computing the correlation between test scores and the criterion behavior
fluid intelligence,our ability to reason speedily and abstractly; tends to decrease during late adulthood
intellectual disability,a condition of limited mental ability  indicated by an intelligence score of 70 or below and difficulty in adapting to the demands of life
heritability,the proportion of variation among individuals that we can attribute to genes
